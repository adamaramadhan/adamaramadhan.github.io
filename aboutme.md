title: About Me
---

I am a PhD candidate at Universiteit Leiden working on the ERC Horizon STG Project [Embodied Imamate: Mapping the Development of the Early Shiʿi Community 700-900 CE( ImBod )](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/humanities/imbod). I first read for a BA in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Leeds before beginning traditional seminary studies at Al-Mahdi Institute where I was trained in the deep and critical reading of classical Arabic texts across a range of disciplines. I then went on to complete an MSt in Islamic Studies and History at the University of Oxford. 

Prior to joining Universiteit Leiden and the ImBod project, I was the Head Librarian at Al-Mahdi Institute where I was responsible for a specialist collection of over 20,000 works related to the study of Islam and the Musilm world. In addition to this, I also have experience in academic administration in various roles at Al-Mahdi Institute. 

I work on the social and intellectual history of Shiʿism. In my PhD research, I am interested in the networks of the Shiʿi Imamate and the role they had in shaping the image and function of the Imam both across and within sectarian boundaries. Aside from this, I maintain an interst in Islamic legal studies, particularly in the Imāmī Shiʿi tradition.
