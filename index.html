title: Adam Ramadhan
subtitle: Adam Ramadhan is a PhD candidate at the Leiden Institute for Area Studies working on the social and intellectual history of early Shiʿism as part of the ERC Starting Grant funded project, Embodied Imamate: Mapping the Development of the Early Shiʿi Community 700-900 CE (ImBod). Adam first read for a BA in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Leeds, graduating with first-class honours and several prizes. He then spent several years undertaking traditional seminary (ḥawza) studies at Al-Mahdi Institute where he was exposed to the deep and critical method of reading classical Arabic texts across a range of disciplines. Adam went on to complete an MSt in Islamic Studies and History at the University of Oxford where he wrote a thesis on the intersection of legal theory (uṣūl al-fiqh) and tradition (ḥadīth) criticism in Imāmī Shiʿi thought. Prior to joining Leiden University and the ImBod project, Adam worked as the Head Librarian of a specialist Islamic Studies library and in academic administration. Adam is also the Coordinator of the British Association for Islamic Studies Prize in the Study of Islam and the Muslim World.
